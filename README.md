# DES
Data Encryption Standard c/c++
This Implementation of DES is part of a collage contest, so once it's finished the source code will be uploaded
For now only the .exe is available at a test bench for user inputs 
# Input Instructions
# 1)Insert "1" for Encryption "0" for Decryption in DECIMAL Notation without quotes
# 2)Insert key in CAPITAL HEXA Notation (Input <= 16 HEXA Digits)
# 3)Insert Data in CAPITAL HEXA NOTATION (Input <= 16 HEXA Digits)
# 4)Insert Number of times to run the algorithm in DECIMAL Notation where (0<=N<=1000)

# Output
# 1)Round keys and all of its intermediate values
# 2)Data(Cipher|Plain) and all intermediate values till (Plain|Cipher) is reached.
